	<h1 id="biography">Biography</h1>
		<p>I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/"> Department of Computer Science </a> at Boston University, 
			currently advised by <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/homer/">Prof. Steven Homer</a>.
			In general, I am interested in Computational Complexity Theory and Algorithm Design. My research currently focuses on 
			Circuit Complexity and Meta-Complexity. In particular, I study the mysterious Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP)
			and focus on proving some barriers on proving its hardness as well as its connections with other topics
			in Theoretical Computer Science.
		</p>
		<p>During the time when I am not occupied with my main research, I tend to participate in Kaggle's Competitions on different types of
			of problems such as regression, text classifying, etc. to self-study and enhance my basic knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science.
			Visit my Github (link above) for the full collection of side projects I have done. Some are listed <a href="#personal-project"> below</a>.
		</p>
		<p>In May 2020, I received a B.A. with Summa Cum Laude and High Honors in Computer Science from Clark University where I was advised by
			<a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/">Prof. Frederick Green</a>. I did some research on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) during 
			my undergraduate study under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cs.clarku.edu/~jmagee/">Prof. John Magee</a>.

					<ul>
						<li>Joint work with Marco Carmosino and Tim Jackman</li>
						<li>Description: we say an extension <b>g</b> of a total Boolean function <b>f</b> with <b>m</b> extra 
							variables is <em>simple</em>, if we can take an optimal Boolean circuit <b>C</b> computing <b>f</b> 
							and add <b>m</b> extra variables and logic gates to <b>C</b> in some way to construct an optimal circuit 
							computing <b>g</b>. For this work, we consider the DeMorgan Basis (which allows AND, OR, and NOT gates only), 
							and NOT-gates can be used for free. 
							When <b>f = XOR</b>, the exclusive-OR function, then the decision problem of finding a 
							<em>simple</em> extension for <b>XOR</b> is conjectured to be intractable which implies
							that this decision problem is a plausible candidate for proving NP-hardness of MCSP.
							In this work, we showed an efficient algorithm that decides the simple extension problem for
							<b>XOR</b> and ultimately rules out this decision problem as a candidate for solving the 
							hardness mystery of MCSP once and for all. Thus, our algorithm formally raised another barrier 
							on proving such hardness.

					<ul>
						<li>Joint work with Marco Carmosino and Tim Jackman</li>
						<li>Description: In the early 19070s, the circuit lower-bound of 2n - O(1) was shown for the Multiplexer function
							(MUX), a Boolean function that commonly appears in practice, by Wolfgang Paul.
							In this work, we aim to improve this lower-bound to 2n + O(<span>&#8730;</span>n) which matches the best 
							known upper-bound for Multiplexer shown by Peter Klein and M.S. Paterson in 1978.

				<li> <em> Minimal XOR Circuits: The One True Shape is a Binary Tree. 2023 </em> 
					<ul>
						<li>Joint work with: Marco Carmosino and Tim Jackman</li>
						<li>Description: The Exclusive-OR function is one of the most fundamental Boolean functions that has appeared 
							in many different contexts in both theory and practice. The circuit lower-bound of 3n - O(1) was shown 
							for XOR by Claus-Peter Schnorr in 1974 under the DeMorgan Basis (which allows AND, OR, and NOT gates only), 
							and NOT-gates can be used for free, and in this setting, XOR has a trivial matching upper-bound. 
							In this work, we push our understanding of XOR further by characterizing the structure of optimal 
							circuits computing XOR.</li>
